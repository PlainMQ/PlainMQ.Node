# PlainMQ.Net

Welcome to the .Net flavour of PlainMQ (more flavours to follow soon if you are willing to help)

## Structure

As things stand there are two sections to this repo:

1. [PlainMQLib](https://github.com/PlainMQ/PlainMQ.Net/tree/master/PlainMQLib) - this is the client SDK that gets packed into a nuget package, to be used in client implementations
2. [Examples](https://github.com/PlainMQ/PlainMQ.Net/tree/master/Examples) - various examples explaining how to use PlainMQLib in combination with a running PlainMQ server

## Contributing

If you feel the urge to contribute either positively or negatively please feel free to open an [Issue](https://github.com/PlainMQ/PlainMQ.Net/issues) on the repo and it will be addressed appropriately in due course.
